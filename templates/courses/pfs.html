            <p>
              When it comes to programming, many scientists feel the frustration of not knowing how to get started to improve their efficiency. That is why we decided to build <b>Python for Scientists</b>, a hands-on course
              in which students will be exposed to all the tools they need to successfully start building solutions in
              Python.
            </p>
            <p>
              This course focuses on the entire workflow that needs to be followed to analyze data. We start by reading files from the hard drive, covering reduction, calibration of signals, etc. Finally, we will generate plots that can be used in a publication. With this simple approach, the students will be challenged to improve on what they know and the way they work.
            </p>
            <p>This is a no BS course. You will not become a programmer after a couple of days, you will become a
              scientists who can program. We will not focus on learning obscure Python tools, nor algorithms to find the roots of an equation. We are going to focus on the practices you need to follow to analyze your data,
              generate figures, and share the process with others.</p>
            <p>
              Do you like what you read, then drop us a line to
              <mark>courses@pythonforthelab.com</mark>
              and we will glad to clarify any of your doubts. This course is offered to groups of up to 7 people in
              order to keep a balanced instructor/student ratio.

            <h3 id="about" data-provide="anchor">About the Course</h3>
            <h6>Intended audience</h6>
            <p>
              The workshop is aimed at young scientists willing to learn how to analyze the data they generate systematically and reliably. <b>Prerequisite</b>: The only requisite to follow the course is to be smart.
              If you are already acquainted with a programming language, or with Python itself, then you will be able to focus on the challenges of the workshop regarding the data at hand. If you are a complete beginner, you
              will find our approach very easy to catch up.
            </p>
            <h6>Technology Stack</h6>
            <p>Python comes in many flavors, we will use a distribution called <b>Anaconda</b> which bundles all the
              basic libraries that a scientists needs. We will use <b>Jupyter Notebooks</b> to analyze data, and we will
              use standard libraries for data manipulation, such as <b>numpy</b>, <b>scipy</b>, and <b>Pandas</b>. We
              will use <b>Matplotlib</b> to generate professional figures which can be used in a publication.</p>
            <h6>Requisites</h6>
            <p>
              To follow the workshop, you will need to bring a laptop with any operating system you normally use and with which you feel comfortable. You will receive installation instructions before the start of the course to prepare your development environment.
            </p>
            <h6>Duration</h6>
            <p>The workshop is offered in two different formats: <b>3 or 5 full-days</b>. The 3-day course
              offers the basic tools a scientist needs when analyzing data, and this time will also be used to learn
              about Python's syntax and best practices.</p>
            <p>In the <b>5 days</b> course, participants will also be introduced to other tools which are very handy to
              distribute code, including <b>Pycharm</b> and <b>Github</b>.</p>
            <p>In both cases, time can be adapted according the group dynamics and background. Biologists will focus on
              biologically-relevant data, but also chemists, physicists, etc. This will keep a high level of engagement with the audience. Depending on the background of the group, there is always room for including extra topics. Certificates of completion are given upon completion of the workshop.</p>
            <h6>About the Instructor</h6>
            <p>Aquiles Carattino completed his Ph.D. in experimental Physics in 2017. During this period, he started
              developing software for his experiments, and in 2017 founded a company to develop software for research labs. By the end of 2017, he created pythonforthelab.com and started offering workshops aiming at creating a strong community of python developers around common technologies and practices. In early 2019,
              Aquiles and some partners founded a new company to develop the next generation of nanoparticle tracking
              devices, which are planned to be released to the market in early 2020.</p>
