        <div class="box-cnt">
          The courses take 3-full days and are aimed at small groups of up to 7 people. Our courses are ideal for young
          Ph.D. candidates and postdocs who want to gain control of their own experiments. We are strongly committed to
          the idea that software should enhance the capabilities of hardware and not the other way around.

          <h3>Target audience</h3>
          We don't require specific programming knowledge to follow the course. If you have a bit of background with
          Python, Matlab or any other language, understand what an if-statement is, and how a for-loop works, then you
          are ready to follow the workshops.

          <blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="mb-0">Excellent course, self-contained and, in my opinion, a great
            stepping stone to find your way to do
            instrumentation with Python. I loved the hands-on approach with a simple REAL device that gives you the
            insights (and experience) into the typical problems you encounter when doing instrumentation for the lab. It
            is very valuable that the trainer shares specific tips and tricks that come from a vast experience in this
            field. A total must for a researcher who wants to design new tools and experiments.</p>
